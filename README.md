# MarsExpressChallenge
The University of Manchester has an industry partnership with BAE Systems. Our BAE Systems industry partner set our group of 5 with the Mars Express Power Challenge, a coding challenge released by the European Space Agency back in 2016.

## Brief Outline
The Mars Express Orbiter is a satellite orbiting Mars, collecting data before sending it back to the ESA base. The orbiter must stay within an optimal temperature range to be able to function properly. This is done through various heaters and coolers present on the spacecraft. The power left over after maintaining temperature can be used on useful scientific operations. Therefore, ESA engineers were interested in being able to predict the thermal power output, so that these scientific operations could be ran more efficiently.

ESA released three Martian years worth of train-test data, and wanted participants to predict the fourth Martian year for evaluation. This data was very complex, and needed manipulation and exploration, before complex machine learning models were to be built.

Please check the attached report file for a full report on the project. Every detail can be found there.

## My Part
In this project, I acted as the group leader, organising meetings, leading discussion and creating agendas. I also contributed greatly in the exploratory and cleaning phase, mainly on the challenging DMOP context file. Finally, I wrote much of the final report, and spoke in the final presentation to our industry partner.
